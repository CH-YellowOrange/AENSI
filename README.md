# AENSI
Attention Enhanced Network with Semantic Inspector for Medical Report Generation

This work can well assist doctors in medical imaging. For more information, please refer to the [paper](https://github.com/CH-YellowOrange/AENSI/tree/main/Paper).

It's fairly simple and all program is in *Codes*. You can check these python files: $\color{#FF3030}{model_vit_selfatt_lbpf_.py}$
**model_vit_selfatt_lbpf_.py** and **MultiHeadAttention_.py** to optimize or improve the performance of our model.

$\color{#FF3030}{red}$



* If you want to train our model, you can use the following command:
  > python train_vit_selfatt_lbpf_.py

* If you want to test it or evaluate it, you can use the following command:
  > python eval_vit_selfatt_lbpf_.py
